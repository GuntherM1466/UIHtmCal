The UIHtmCal is a research application that allows easy experimentation of Numenta's Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithms using Usage Tracking from Windows Operating Systems as well as 
other test data.

The UIHtmCal runs a C# implementation of  HTM algorithm which is leaned on the implementation Barry Maturkanich with changes done by myself. The purpose of this project is to test how 
to make interpretable predictions with HTM. In order to use this project you should have visuals studio installed with NET-Framework of at least 3.5. Import the Project Solution 
UIHtmCal.sln in Visual Studio and run the program


Additional background:

Numenta (www.numenta.com) is designing an exciting new technology based on models of the neocortex called "Hierarchical Temporal Memory".

Their most recent work on HTM, also called the "Cortical Learning Algorithms", is so far unreleased as a software project.  However they have published fairly detailed documentation as well as pseudo-code of how the overall algorithm works.

Numenta is currently allowing non-commerical experimentation by interested developers who wish to implement the ideas from the documention.  However, the algorithm is not free to use in any commericial or production setting.

If you are motivated enough, please also take a look at the code itself to review the details of my Region implementation. I gladly welcome any feedback or suggestions about how I am doing things or what I may be doing wrong.  An easy place for doing so is the 'HTM Theory' forum on www.numenta.com, I am 'binarybarry' there as well.
